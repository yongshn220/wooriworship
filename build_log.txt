./app/board/[teamId]/(notice)/notice-board/_components/notice-header-list.tsx
36:40  Warning: The ref value 'loadMoreRef.current' will likely have changed by the time this effect cleanup function runs. If this ref points to a node rendered by React, copy 'loadMoreRef.current' to a variable inside the effect, and use that variable in the cleanup function.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./app/board/[teamId]/(song)/song-board/_components/song-list.tsx
38:40  Warning: The ref value 'loadMoreRef.current' will likely have changed by the time this effect cleanup function runs. If this ref points to a node rendered by React, copy 'loadMoreRef.current' to a variable inside the effect, and use that variable in the cleanup function.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./app/board/[teamId]/(worship)/worship/[worshipId]/_components/song-carousel-item.tsx
47:21  Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` to automatically optimize images. This may incur additional usage or cost from your provider. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element  @next/next/no-img-element

./app/board/[teamId]/(worship)/worship/[worshipId]/worship-view/_components/worship-live-carousel-item.tsx
40:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'musicSheets?.length'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
74:19  Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` to automatically optimize images. This may incur additional usage or cost from your provider. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element  @next/next/no-img-element

./app/board/[teamId]/(worship)/worship/[worshipId]/worship-view/_components/worship-live-preference.tsx
21:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'setPageMode'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./app/board/[teamId]/(worship)/worship-board/_components/worship-card-list.tsx
22:9  Warning: The 'worshipIds' conditional could make the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 55) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the initialization of 'worshipIds' in its own useMemo() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
41:40  Warning: The ref value 'loadMoreRef.current' will likely have changed by the time this effect cleanup function runs. If this ref points to a node rendered by React, copy 'loadMoreRef.current' to a variable inside the effect, and use that variable in the cleanup function.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
44:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'setDisplayedCount'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./app/board/[teamId]/(worship)/worship-board/_components/worship-card.tsx
93:9  Warning: The 'songs' conditional could make the dependencies of useMemo Hook (at line 106) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the initialization of 'songs' in its own useMemo() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./app/board/page.tsx
33:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'router'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./app/not-found.tsx
13:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'router'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/elements/design/song/song-detail-card/default/parts/song-detail-music-sheet-area.tsx
49:11  Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` to automatically optimize images. This may incur additional usage or cost from your provider. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element  @next/next/no-img-element
68:17  Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` to automatically optimize images. This may incur additional usage or cost from your provider. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element  @next/next/no-img-element

./components/elements/design/song/song-list/worship-form/parts/addable-song-header-list.tsx
43:40  Warning: The ref value 'loadMoreRef.current' will likely have changed by the time this effect cleanup function runs. If this ref points to a node rendered by React, copy 'loadMoreRef.current' to a variable inside the effect, and use that variable in the cleanup function.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/ui/multiple-selector.tsx
262:8  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'onSearch'. Either include it or remove the dependency array. If 'onSearch' changes too often, find the parent component that defines it and wrap that definition in useCallback.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/util/hook/use-pdfjs.tsx
19:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'onLoad'. Either include it or remove the dependency array. If 'onLoad' changes too often, find the parent component that defines it and wrap that definition in useCallback.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
19:15  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a spread element in its dependency array. This means we can't statically verify whether you've passed the correct dependencies.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/util/provider/initialization.tsx
42:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has an unnecessary dependency: 'auth.currentUser'. Either exclude it or remove the dependency array. Outer scope values like 'auth.currentUser' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
